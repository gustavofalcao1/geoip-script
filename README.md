# 🌍 GeoIP Lookup Script

**GeoIP Script** is a simple and effective shell script that allows you to determine the geographical location of a given IP address or domain. It leverages the `geoiplookup` utility to return relevant information such as country, region, and city in a lightweight, command-line format.

This tool was developed as part of early experimentation with shell scripting on Linux systems.
